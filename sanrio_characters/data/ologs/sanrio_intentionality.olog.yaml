    name: "Sanrio Character Design - Intentionality"
    version: "1.0.0"
    description: |
      Explains WHY Sanrio characters work and what makes them feel distinctly "Sanrio."
      Captures the sensory principles, design intentions, and composition strategies
      that make these characters universally adorable.
    
    core_insight: |
      Sanrio doesn't create characters; Sanrio reveals what makes something inherently cute.
      Every design choice answers: "Does this increase approachability without losing identity?"
      The genius is mathematical: proportion precision, color restraint, feature economy.

  # CHARACTER ARCHETYPES (with intentions and principles)
  # ============================================================================
  
  instances:
    
    joyful_character_archetype:
      character_type: "emotional_tone"
      examples: ["Hello Kitty", "Badtz-Maru variations"]
      
      core_intention: "Universal happiness through proportion exuberance"
      commercial_promise: |
        "This character will make people smile. Its proportions broadcast joy
        before they ever see its face. The roundness is confidence; the pastel
        is optimism."
      
      composition_principle: |
        Joyful Sanrio characters use:
        - Round or buoyant head shapes (large_round_orb, tilted_oval)
        - Generous proportions (head-dominant or balanced)
        - Expressive faces (dot_eyes_curved_smile, large_oval_eyes)
        - Warm color palettes (butter_yellow_peach, light_coral)
        - Medium to larger size (displayable, approachable)
      
      why_this_works: |
        Roundness is universally read as safe and non-threatening.
        Pastel warmth triggers comfort responses. Head-dominant proportions
        make characters appear innocent and trustworthy. Expressive faces
        communicate openness. Together, these create an "I'm happy to see you"
        sensation that transcends language.
      
      sensory_principles:
        - expansiveness: "Each element adds optimistic visual weight"
        - clarity: "Face is immediately readable as happy"
        - approachability: "Nothing sharp, angular, or threatening"
        - warmth: "Color temperature invites interaction"
      
      proportion_rules:
        head_to_body: "0.8 to 1.0 (prominent, expressive)"
        facial_feature_count: "3 (eyes + mouth, clear and bright)"
        color_saturation: "balanced to vivid (readable from distance)"
      
      design_intent_keywords:
        - "joyful"
        - "cheerful"
        - "bright"
        - "open"
        - "welcoming"
        - "innocent"
        - "safe"
      
      forbidden_combinations:
        - "joyful + angular head shape"
        - "joyful + muted color triad"
        - "joyful + serene/neutral facial style"
      rationale: |
        These combinations contradict the core intention. Angular shapes
        suggest wariness, muted colors suggest sadness, neutral faces
        suppress the emotional clarity.
    
    melancholic_character_archetype:
      character_type: "emotional_tone"
      examples: ["Aggretsuko variations", "Cinnamoroll (melancholic moments)"]
      
      core_intention: "Approachability through acknowledged sadness"
      commercial_promise: |
        "This character feels what I feel. It doesn't pretend to be happy.
        In recognizing my sadness, it makes sadness less lonely."
      
      composition_principle: |
        Melancholic Sanrio characters use:
        - Drooping or elongated shapes (elongated_teardrop, wide_and_flat)
        - Head-heavy proportions (tiny_torso_large_head, head-dominant)
        - Soft or minimal faces (closed_happy_eyes, serene_neutral_expression)
        - Muted color palettes (dusty_rose_sage, pale_gray_pink)
        - Smaller size (intimate, not imposing)
      
      why_this_works: |
        Drooping shapes are visually metaphorical for sadness (shoulders down).
        Head-heavy proportions suggest introspection and inward focus.
        Closed eyes or neutral expressions refuse false cheerfulness.
        Muted colors match internal grey emotional weather. Small size
        makes the character vulnerable, which paradoxically makes it safer—
        you're the strong one, protecting something delicate.
      
      sensory_principles:
        - honesty: "Refuses to pretend happiness"
        - vulnerability: "Proportions suggest fragility"
        - softness: "Muted colors and rounded elements are gentle"
        - intimacy: "Small size creates personal, one-on-one feeling"
      
      proportion_rules:
        head_to_body: "1.2 to 2.0 (introspective, heavy with feeling)"
        facial_feature_count: "1-2 (minimal, suggesting withdrawn)"
        color_saturation: "muted (matching internal emotional state)"
      
      design_intent_keywords:
        - "melancholic"
        - "sad"
        - "wistful"
        - "lonely"
        - "introspective"
        - "vulnerable"
        - "drooping"
      
      forbidden_combinations:
        - "melancholic + large_round_orb head"
        - "melancholic + vivid color triad"
        - "melancholic + dot_eyes_curved_smile"
      rationale: |
        Round heads broadcast confidence (contradicts melancholy).
        Vivid colors suggest energy (contradicts sadness).
        Curved smiles deny the emotional reality.
    
    anxious_character_archetype:
      character_type: "emotional_tone"
      examples: ["Keroppi in worried moments", "Stress-related Sanrio designs"]
      
      core_intention: "Nervous energy that's still lovable"
      commercial_promise: |
        "This character is worried, but it's okay. Worry is relatable.
        This small, tense thing is still cute and safe to care about."
      
      composition_principle: |
        Anxious Sanrio characters use:
        - Slightly angular or tense shapes (simplified_geometric, ovoid_with_point)
        - Head-dominant proportions (large head, small body for vulnerability)
        - Expressive but tense faces (curious_expression, minimal_expression)
        - Cool or neutral color palettes (pale_blue_lilac, pale_gray)
        - Pocket-sized (small enough to hold and protect)
      
      why_this_works: |
        Slight angularity reads as tension without aggression. Head dominance
        suggests overthinking. Cool colors match anxious "freezing" sensations.
        Pocket-sized makes the character holdable—you can protect it.
        Together: "I'm worried but I'm small and harmless."
      
      sensory_principles:
        - recognizability: "Anxiety is a universal experience"
        - manageable_intensity: "Tension expressed but not overwhelming"
        - protectibility: "Size and proportions invite caregiving"
        - honesty: "Doesn't pretend to confidence"
      
      proportion_rules:
        head_to_body: "0.9 to 1.5 (overthinking, big feelings in small package)"
        facial_feature_count: "2-3 (expressive worry)"
        color_saturation: "balanced to muted (not overstimulating)"
      
      design_intent_keywords:
        - "anxious"
        - "worried"
        - "nervous"
        - "tense"
        - "stressed"
        - "tentative"
        - "uptight"
      
      forbidden_combinations:
        - "anxious + large size categories"
        - "anxious + warm, vivid colors"
        - "anxious + serene facial expression"
      rationale: |
        Large sizes reduce the protective feeling. Warm vivid colors seem
        dismissive of real worry. Serene expressions deny the emotional state.
    
    sleepy_character_archetype:
      character_type: "emotional_tone"
      examples: ["Gudetama (eternal tiredness)", "Badtz-Maru sleeping variations"]
      
      core_intention: "Cozy acceptance of rest and low energy"
      commercial_promise: |
        "It's okay to be tired. Rest is valid. This character makes
        tiredness feel safe and even precious."
      
      composition_principle: |
        Sleepy Sanrio characters use:
        - Soft, drooping shapes (minimalist_blob, elongated_teardrop)
        - Relaxed proportions (limbless_blob, extended_and_fluid)
        - Closed or half-closed faces (closed_happy_eyes, minimal_expression)
        - Warm but muted colors (peachy_cream_blue, dusty_rose_sage)
        - Small or medium size (cozy, nestable)
      
      why_this_works: |
        Drooping shapes are physically associated with relaxation and gravity.
        Limbless or fluid proportions suggest melting into rest. Closed eyes
        are sleeping. Warm-muted colors are like comfortable blankets.
        Small size makes the character seem like something you could cuddle.
      
      sensory_principles:
        - softness: "Every element is gentle and non-threatening"
        - relaxation: "Shapes suggest abandoning tension"
        - nurture: "Proportions invite protective care"
        - warmth: "Color temperature is comforting, not stimulating"
      
      proportion_rules:
        head_to_body: "flexible (0.5 to 1.5) - sleeping creatures can be any shape"
        facial_feature_count: "0-1 (minimal, eyes closed or absent)"
        color_saturation: "muted to warm (soothing)"
      
      design_intent_keywords:
        - "sleepy"
        - "tired"
        - "drowsy"
        - "cozy"
        - "restful"
        - "lazy"
        - "relaxed"
      
      forbidden_combinations:
        - "sleepy + angular shapes"
        - "sleepy + cool, desaturated colors (too stark)"
        - "sleepy + expressive, alert faces"
      rationale: |
        Angular shapes suggest alertness. Cool, desaturated colors feel
        clinical, not cozy. Alert faces contradict the sleepy intention.
    
    mischievous_character_archetype:
      character_type: "emotional_tone"
      examples: ["Badtz-Maru normal mode", "Playful character variations"]
      
      core_intention: "Harmless trouble-making that's fun, not mean"
      commercial_promise: |
        "This character has personality and spunk. It's bold enough to
        break rules but kind enough that you enjoy it."
      
      composition_principle: |
        Mischievous Sanrio characters use:
        - Slightly angular or spirited shapes (cat_like_curved, tilted_oval)
        - Balanced or slightly head-dominant proportions
        - Expressive, knowing faces (curious_expression, dot_eyes with attitude)
        - Warm, slightly saturated colors (butter_yellow, light_coral)
        - Small to medium size (agile, nimble)
      
      why_this_works: |
        Slight angles suggest sharpness without menace. Tilted heads are
        quizzical and playful. Expressive faces show personality. Warm colors
        prevent mischief from feeling mean. The character is small enough
        to seem harmless but spirited enough to seem interesting.
      
      sensory_principles:
        - personality: "Character has opinions and energy"
        - harmlessness: "Trouble-making is playful, not cruel"
        - spiritedness: "Proportion and color suggest vitality"
        - relatability: "Everyone has a mischievous side"
      
      proportion_rules:
        head_to_body: "0.7 to 1.0 (confident but not arrogant)"
        facial_feature_count: "2-3 (expressive personality)"
        color_saturation: "warm, balanced to slightly vivid"
      
      design_intent_keywords:
        - "mischievous"
        - "playful"
        - "cheeky"
        - "spirited"
        - "clever"
        - "witty"
        - "impish"
      
      forbidden_combinations:
        - "mischievous + drooping shapes (sad vibe)"
        - "mischievous + muted colors (tired vibe)"
        - "mischievous + serene expression (no personality)"
      rationale: |
        Drooping shapes undermine the playfulness. Muted colors make
        mischief seem tiresome. Serene expressions remove the personality.
    
    dreamy_character_archetype:
      character_type: "emotional_tone"
      examples: ["Cinnamoroll (dreamy mood)", "Fantasy-themed characters"]
      
      core_intention: "Escape into imagination and wonder"
      commercial_promise: |
        "This character invites you into a magical world where anything
        is possible. Reality is softer here."
      
      composition_principle: |
        Dreamy Sanrio characters use:
        - Organic, impossible shapes (minimalist_blob, extended_and_fluid)
        - Flexible proportions that defy gravity
        - Wonder-filled faces (curious_expression, large_oval_eyes)
        - Ethereal color palettes (soft_peachy_cream_blue, light_mint_pink)
        - Any size (dreamland has no rules)
      
      why_this_works: |
        Organic shapes that don't perfectly match reality suggest unreality.
        Proportions that defy normal body mechanics suggest dream-logic.
        Curious, wonder-filled expressions suggest awe. Ethereal colors
        feel unreal and magical. Together, they create cognitive dissonance
        that reads as "this is from another world."
      
      sensory_principles:
        - surrealism: "Things don't quite follow normal rules"
        - wonder: "Expressions and proportions suggest amazement"
        - softness: "Colors and shapes are dreamy, not harsh"
        - possibility: "The character implies worlds beyond the normal"
      
      proportion_rules:
        head_to_body: "flexible and unconventional (0.5 to 2.0+)"
        facial_feature_count: "1-3 (wonder, not overwhelm)"
        color_saturation: "ethereal, slightly desaturated"
      
      design_intent_keywords:
        - "dreamy"
        - "ethereal"
        - "magical"
        - "surreal"
        - "whimsical"
        - "impossible"
        - "fantasy"
      
      forbidden_combinations:
        - "dreamy + geometric, angular shapes (too grounded)"
        - "dreamy + vivid, saturated colors (too real)"
        - "dreamy + minimal features (needs wonder)"
      rationale: |
        Angular shapes anchor things to reality. Vivid colors feel too
        present and immediate. Minimal features remove the sense of
        character and wonder.
    
    determined_character_archetype:
      character_type: "emotional_tone"
      examples: ["Badtz-Maru in boss mode", "Warrior variations"]
      
      core_intention: "Cute confidence and unstoppable spirit"
      commercial_promise: |
        "This character is small but mighty. You can be powerful without
        being large or scary."
      
      composition_principle: |
        Determined Sanrio characters use:
        - Upright, confident shapes (simplified_geometric, large_round_orb)
        - Balanced or body-focused proportions
        - Confident, focused faces (curious_expression, minimal_expression)
        - Warm or cool, saturated colors (no muted palette)
        - Medium to large size (presence and authority)
      
      why_this_works: |
        Upright shapes read as confident. Balanced proportions suggest
        strength without heaviness. Focused faces show intention. Saturated
        colors convey energy and commitment. Larger size projects authority
        without menace. Together: "I'm small but I have purpose."
      
      sensory_principles:
        - confidence: "Proportions and expression show commitment"
        - capability: "Shape suggests readiness for action"
        - approachability: "Still cute despite determination"
        - inspiration: "Character motivates action"
      
      proportion_rules:
        head_to_body: "0.6 to 0.8 (balanced, grounded, capable)"
        facial_feature_count: "2-3 (focused expression)"
        color_saturation: "saturated, warm or cool"
      
      design_intent_keywords:
        - "determined"
        - "strong"
        - "fierce"
        - "bold"
        - "warrior"
        - "powerful"
        - "confident"
      
      forbidden_combinations:
        - "determined + drooping shapes (weakness)"
        - "determined + muted colors (fatigue)"
        - "determined + serene/minimal expression (passivity)"
      rationale: |
        Drooping shapes undermine confidence. Muted colors suggest
        weariness. Serene expressions contradict determination.

  # ============================================================================
  # UNIVERSAL DESIGN PRINCIPLES (apply to all archetypes)
  # ============================================================================
  
  universal_principles:
    
    principle_proportion_precision:
      statement: |
        The ratio of head to body, not the absolute size, determines cuteness.
        A 1:1 ratio is always cute. A 2:1 ratio is introspective.
        A 0.5:1 ratio is confident. The precision matters more than
        the magnitude.
      
      implication: |
        Characters can be designed at any actual size. The proportional
        relationships remain constant. Sanrio's genius is mathematical
        rather than material.
    
    principle_feature_economy:
      statement: |
        Every feature must earn its existence. If a character has
        three facial features, each should communicate distinct emotional
        information. One feature wasted is adorability points lost.
      
      implication: |
        Blank faces are sometimes cuter than busy faces. Minimalism
        is a deliberate choice, not a limitation.
    
    principle_pastel_restraint:
      statement: |
        Color saturation is emotional temperature. Muted colors create
        intimacy and melancholy. Vivid colors create celebration and joy.
        The choice must match the emotional intention.
      
      implication: |
        All Sanrio characters live in the pastel spectrum. Outside this
        spectrum, characters stop being Sanrio. This is not limiting;
        it's defining.
    
    principle_approachability_priority:
      statement: |
        Before anything else, a Sanrio character must be safe to approach.
        No sharp edges (metaphorical or literal). No expressions of judgment
        or anger. The character must welcome you.
      
      implication: |
        This is why Sanrio characters work across all ages and cultures.
        They speak to something universal: the desire to be welcomed.
    
    principle_emotional_honesty:
      statement: |
        Sanrio characters never pretend to emotions they don't have.
        A sad character is sad. A sleepy character is tired. This honesty
        paradoxically increases approachability because people trust it.
      
      implication: |
        You can never "fix" a sad Sanrio character by making it smile.
        The sadness is the point. The permission to feel the feeling
        is the gift.

  # ============================================================================
  # INHERITANCE AND EXTENSION RULES
  # ============================================================================
  
  inheritance_guidance: |
    When creating new Sanrio characters (variants, new archetypes, or
    experimental designs), inherit from these principles:
    
    1. Start with emotional_tone as the prime.
       All other choices must express this emotion.
    
    2. Select head_shape and body_proportion based on the archetype's
       composition_principle, not arbitrary preference.
    
    3. Validate against forbidden_combinations for that archetype.
       If you want to break the rules, you're creating something new,
       not a Sanrio character.
    
    4. Apply universal_principles as hard constraints:
       - Always maintain proportional_precision
       - Always practice feature_economy
       - Always honor pastel_restraint
       - Always prioritize approachability
       - Always maintain emotional_honesty
    
    5. Use design_intent_keywords to generate character variations.
       A variation inherits the archetype's emotional_tone and keeps
       at least 2 of its defining proportional choices.
    
    Example: Creating a "determined_but_anxious" variation:
    - Inherit from: determined_character_archetype
    - Modify: Add slightly angular shapes to suggest tension
    - Keep: Warm, saturated colors (determined), medium size (determined)
    - Validate: Does this still read as the intended emotion?
    - Rule check: Is it still approachable? Emotionally honest?
